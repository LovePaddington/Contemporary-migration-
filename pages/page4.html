	<h1 style=" color:white;">Article 4: The moral by Flora </h1>
	
			 <p style=" color:white;">The moral has a great impact on children’s education. It is really important that children can be aware of situations and it has a part of being open-minded about migration.  </p>
			<p style=" color:white;"> Animated movies can introduce a different aspect of migration than the one that they can see on television or hear at home. On television, migration is often seen as a problem and very often migrants are badly represented. What children can hear or see about that can impact their future opinions.</p>
			<p style=" color:white;"> Whereas at the end of <i>Paddington</i>, the father tells that he will love Paddington even if he is “different”, which is open-minded and tells that we have to love every person. Paddington has a hidden moral with the use of a lovely character that catches our attention and it makes us feel compassion. It is a hidden way to transfer a very important message about acceptance.
Paddington spreads a message of hope instead of spreading a bad representation of migrants. As a child, you see a part of a situation but when you grow up you understand the hidden facts of the film.</p>
			<p style=" color:white;"> Learning values as a child brings to the basis of moral. If you understand these values already in childhood it can only permit you to become an open-minded person. And as a grown up person you can see the real point of view of the movie about acceptance and make a link with what happens in the reality.</p>
			<p style=" color:white;"> In <i>An American Tail</i> we see that a French immigrant is building the Statue of Liberty and that at the end of the movie, the Statue is finished. So we can say that at the beginning of the movie, something was in construction and at the end, everything was put in place, it’s a part of moral and how you can evolve with yourself and change your mind and dealing with something that may have been a problem for you, and at the end you change. The Statue represents something in construction, here, it is acceptance.</p>
