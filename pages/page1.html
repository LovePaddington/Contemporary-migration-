	<h1 style=" color:white;"> Article 1: The beginning of the journey by Sophie </h1>
	
    <p style=" color:white;">“Please, look after this bear, thank you” wrote Aunt Lucy on Paddington’s necklace just before he left from Peru. Migration is about leaving a place for various reasons, but it also means leaving habits, customs and family. Luggages carried by migrants can not transport such things; only their minds can keep memories. This is what it is all about in the beginnings of <i>Paddington</i> and <i>An American Tail</i>. Why do they migrate? How? Who? 
Let’s focus on migrants ‘ journey through the main characters Paddington and Fievel.</p>
	<p style=" color:white;">First and foremost, why did they decide to leave? Those animated movies show two main reasons that exist in real life: leaving because of a natural disaster or because of political reasons and dream for a better life. Paddington’s habitat was destroyed and his family died, except Aunt Lucy. However, she can not look after him anymore and wants him to go to her friend-explorer’s house in England.
However, the journey lasts a long time and both characters have to face difficulties on boat. Indeed those trips are extremely dangerous and those animated movies show a light vision of the reality. It is important to remember that more than 2260 migrants died on the Mediterranean Sea in 2018. What is also striking is the increase of those digits...But as we know our protagonists do not die in the stories. Nevertheless, Paddington suffers from anxiety, insecurity and feeling of being lost. Fievel in <i>An American Tail</i> falls from the boat because of the rough and choppy sea. Even if musics and humor tones down those scenes in animated movies, the reality is worst.</p>
	<p style=" color:white;">Moreover, what is also difficult for both characters is to experience such a journey alone, separated from their family for an unknown future. For instance, Fievel is brought to travel alone in a bottle on sea while the rest of his community is on the boat. They are missing each other until Fievel manages to find them in New York. Paddington is also alone because Aunt Lucy is too old to travel. Kissing goodbye is harder when there are only few chances to see each other again. Not every person affected by migration can leave and this is actually real in our 2019-world. 
Therefore the only things you can bring are memories, but nostalgia goes along with. Both characters are wearing a hat, but what for? In Paddington it is not only to look like an explorer, it is also a symbol of transmission between the explorer, Paddington’s granda and himself. This object, as simple as it is, is important to him and reminds him his family. Such things can be so important when you own only a few things that Fievel risks his life to keep it and finally falls into the sea. Well, it can be an object, photos, memories or a letter on a necklace, memories and pre life can not be forgotten.</p>
	<p style=" color:white;">Therefore, emigrating is not only physically dangerous but also spiritually hard. Leaving home may also mean leaving the ones we love. Migrants’ luggages are not big, but their minds are full of memories, songs, food, language, landscapes… and dreams. Paddington’s suitcase only contains letters for Aunt Lucy. Those animated movies represent a lighter reality to children.</p>
	<p style=" color:white;">Then what happens once on that new land?</p>
