		<h1>Article 2: The Journey of a migrant: the arrival by Leïla </h1>

  <p>Now let’s look at Paddington for what he really is in our society, and consider his status as an illegal immigrant.</p>
<p>In the original film, Paddington steal a boat to go to London, but the truth is, he doesn't even know for sure that it will go to London. 
He then successfully manages to enter the territory without being detected, and arrives at the Paddington station. But when the Brown came near him, the father says some racist comments that we can easily linked with how people treat migrant in reality. Migrant almost always face rejection, at least in the public opinion, and are victims of prejudices. Very few people are willing to let them a chance, like Mrs. Brown</p>
<p>Under section 24 of the Immigration Act 1971, Paddington is an illegal entrant and has committed a criminal offence. Assisting unlawful immigration is also a criminal offence, but having assisted Paddington only after his arrival in the UK the Brown family would probably escape prosecution.</p>
<p>If he claims asylum, Paddington’s first problem will have to convince the authorities that he really is a child. Being a bear, this would be a very difficult matter to handle. It remains us of the situation of actual refugees that struggled to prove their age and situation.
Paddington will be interviewed for his asylum claim, and quickly deemed not included into the legal definition of a refugee dictated in the 1951 UN Convention because fleeing a natural disaster is not enough, as authorities considers there are other option, such as moving into the home country.
This shows that the system is unfair, as he has reasons to flee his country, and to seek protection elsewhere, but given the law, he won’t have a chance.</p>
<p>The difference we have with real life and the movie is that Paddington end well for the main character, as he is able to find his place in London, not only within the society (by being a cop at some moment) but also having a family. We stay in a movie, while it has some repercussion to make children learn about the subject, it has to remain mild, and teach them to respect and not judge other people

                <li><h3>section 24 of the Immigration Act, 1971</h3></li>
                    <p>Illegal entry and similar offences.</p>
	            <p>(1)A person who is not a British citizen shall be guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction with a fine of not more than [F2[F3level 5]on the standard scale] or with imprisonment for not more than six months, or with both, in if contrary to this Act he knowingly enters the United Kingdom in breach of a deportation order or without leave</>	 
                <li><h3>1951 UN Convention </h3></li>
                    <p>Ratified by 145 State parties, it defines the term ‘refugee’ and outlines the rights of the displaced, as well as the legal obligations of States to protect them.</p>
		    <p>The core principle is non-refoulement, which asserts that a refugee should not be returned to a country where they face serious threats to their life or freedom. This is now considered a rule of customary international law.</p>
