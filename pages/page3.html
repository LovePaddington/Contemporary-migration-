	<h1 style=" color:white;">Article 3: Xenophobia, Assimilation and bad conditions by Adeline</h1>
		
		<p>As Colin Yeo wrote in his article about Paddington on his website freemovement.org, “Paddington’s story is that of the modern migrant. He is in many ways typical of my clients.”

When Paddington was found and got a home thanks to the Brown’s family, many good and bad things happened to him. He thought he was going to be appreciated by the Londoners because it is what his Aunt Lucy said to him back in Peru. The truth is: it does not work that way. Some people are open-minded, but some are not.
For example, Mr. Brown does not like Paddington right away. He said, “having a bear in a house increases the chance of a major disaster by 4.000%”. A lot of persons would think that about immigrants or refugees. It is called xenophobia. Xenophobia is when someone has the fear or hatred of people from different culture, or strangers. It is extremely real and more common that we can think it could be. For having another example, Mr. Curry, Brown’s neighbor, is a xenophobe. In the movie he did everything to see Paddington go back to his country. He did not call Paddington by his name, but by “Bear” as well as in <i>An American Tail</i>, Fievel was named “Philly” in America because they wanted an Americanized name for him.
It is quite clear that with Mr. Brown and Mr. Curry characters we see how in real life people can be. They do not want to have other people having a different culture coming to where they live. They are not taking a person as an individual. They almost see them as an “it” and they do not want to take the persons as they are. 

			Besides, all along the <i>Paddington</i> movie, we see how Paddington is trying to understand and be like Londoners. He wants to fit in. He has a perfect old-fashioned English, but he does not know how to use the facilities or the “typical normal stuff.”
For every immigrant it is complicated to fit in because the country they decided to come is different from their home or previous country. 
Nevertheless, Paddington shows to the Brown’s family how doing his marmalade. First, it was the English explorer that found Aunt Lucy and Pastuzo who gave the marmalade recipe to them. Then Aunt Lucy and Pastuzo had created a business of marmalade, and they give this to Paddington. Even if he is struggling with assimilation, he is giving a part of his culture, which was first an English culture, to his new family. 

			Added to this, in <i>An American Tail</i>, we see when immigrants or refugees are forced to work for someone else in bad conditions to survive in a new country. 
Fievel, the little mouse, was brought to a workhouse. We can relate this to immigrants since they do not have money and only accept this because they know they will have a roof and a bit of money. 
It is one of the sad things about reality. And in the movie they portray it in a good way because we see how the mice are tired of working there but they do not have a choice. 

In short, we can only be thankful for these two animated movies to talk about assimilation, xenophobia and working in bad conditions to survive in a new country among others!</p>
